  3. Write a program to create a Rectangle class with two private data members: length and width. 
     Create a default constructor that initialises both members to 0 and a parameterized constructor. 
     Create two different objects of class Rectangle using these different types of constructors and display 
     their values using a member function. Write a destructor that prints a message when an object is 
     destroyed.

     Write member functions
       1. To input values to data members
       2. To display Time in Hour:minute: second format. 3.
       3. To find the sum of two Time objects using a friend function.

  10. Create a base class Person with data members name and age, and a member function display().
      Derive a class Student from Person that adds a data member roll_number and a member function 
      showDetails(). Demonstrate single inheritance by creating an object of the Student class and calling
      both base and derived class functions.

  11. Write a program to create a base class BankAccount with attributes like account_number and
      balance, and functions deposit() and withdraw().
      Derive two classes:
        1. SavingsAccount with data member rate_of_interst and an additional function
           calculateInterest() and display it.
        2. CurrentAccount, which requires maintaining a minimum balance and an additional
           function to calculate servicecharge() and reduce it from the balance, and display the details.
           Demonstrate inheritance by performing operations on objects of both derived classes.
